Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK) cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection(1–3), implying that NK cells are playing a role in these T cell-associated diseases. While direct NK cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to anti-viral defense during some virus infections, especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans(4–5), NK cells have also been suspected as having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells(6–7). In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choromeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems resistant to any direct anti-viral effects of NK cells(5,8). Here the roles of NK cells in regulating T cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology were examined in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus dose NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at a medium dose NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T cell-mediated support for the anti-viral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.",20/11/2011,"Waggoner, Stephen N.; Cornberg, Markus; Selin, Liisa K.; Welsh, Raymond M.",Nature,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7eda5983227631fbb80f7ccc01c9f4c61cda3afc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1d207b14f92ffce3c151c86f9483c159065e0646.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3539796.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539796/,

However, recently it was discovered that IFITs could directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5′-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here, we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an N-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA, RIG-I. Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence specific manner and requires approximately a 3-nucleotide 5′-overhang. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to cause a defect in the anti-viral response by HEK cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA and lend insight into their downstream effector function.",13/01/2013,"Abbas, Yazan M.; Pichlmair, Andreas; Górna, Maria W.; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Nagar, Bhushan",Nature,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2bf8ae683ef919a724c5623efda3a71110d57ddd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e541cde18344acd8299e4bcfdf4d81a86206321b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/24a4abb7e742c132b76b859fd53acfc1a126ba05.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8998c16e58fa4d41fe2b226c721fb898d2a8eb74.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4931921.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4931921/,

Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs(4). However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries(5–7). Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range – which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of ‘missing viruses’ and ‘missing zoonoses’ and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.",21/06/2017,"Olival, Kevin J.; Hosseini, Parviez R.; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Ross, Noam; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Daszak, Peter",Nature,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e92e2d8ab6aedfa9c7486162c9520e4ea4485df2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/13493c8f5f1d8063c462a6fb93e31a82eae2fd26.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5570460.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5570460/,

The prolonged bleeding time in VWD has been attributed to the absence of a plasma factor, the von Willebrand factor (VWF), as shown by a correction of the bleeding time after infusion of normal and haemophilic plasmas(1). Addition of purified factor VIII in vitro specifically corrects the abnormal platelet retention and ristocetin aggregation in VWD(2–5), whereas transfusion of similar material into dogs with VWD also corrects the prolonged bleeding time (B.N.B., W. J. Dodds, J. A. van Mourik, J.J.S and W. P. Webster, unpublished). This led to the suggestion that factor VIII is closely related if not identical to VWF, although dissociation of factor VIII procoagulant activity from factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII-RA) is observed in certain conditions(6,7). The plasma concentration of F VIII-RA is usually reduced in VWD suggesting a reduced synthesis of factor VIII (VWF)(8). In contrast to this we now report the presence of normal concentrations of F VIII-RA in platelets of patients with VWD. This F VIII-RA supported aggregation induced by ristocetin in a washed platelet system(9), a property of factor VIII which has been attributed to VWF activity.",1975,"BOUMA, B. N.; HORDIJK-HOS, J.

Nucleic acid sequences related to the RD-114 genome are in the DNA of all domestic cats(5–8). Thus these viral genomes are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring as integral components of cat cellular DNA. Although the family Felidae consists of closely related animals, only four Felis species have been found to contain RD-114-related sequences. These include the domestic cat, the European wildcat (F. sylvestris), the sand cat (F. margarita), and the jungle cat (F. chaus); other members of the Felidae lack nucleic acid sequences related to RD-114 (ref. 9). The observation that RD-114 is partially related to the endogenous baboon type C viruses(10–12) and that sequences related to RD-114 are found in the cellular DNA of all Old World monkeys led to the postulate that this group of viruses originated from an endogenous primate type C virus(13) transmitted horizontally to the germ line of ancestors of certain Felis species during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene somewhere in the region of the Mediterranean basin(9).",1975,"BENVENISTE, RAOUL E.; TODARO, GEORGE J.",Nature,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/23d9759a661ac8679e869223b1c6539c51f7161c.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086506/,

The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(2). This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease(3). This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptor-binding specificity for human-like α2,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus.
